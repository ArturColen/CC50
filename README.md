# CC50
Repository created to share the projects developed during the [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) Introduction to Computer Science course, where I was able to learn about several programming and development technologies.

## üöß Projects
### C
* Recreating the pyramids of Mario World on the terminal;
* Creating a counter for the amount of coins (cents) to be given as change to a user.
* Generation of a credit card verifier, where you can find out if your format is valid, as well as your flag.
* Creation of a calculator for the number of years it will take for a given population to go from one value to another.
* Program created to analyze, through a text entered by the user, its readability level using the Coleman-Liau index.

## üíª Technologies used 
* [C](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/cpp/c-language/?view=msvc-170): programming language

## üìÅ Access and execute the projects
## C
### 1. Open the [CS50 IDE](https://code.cs50.io/)
### 2. Click `Log in via GitHub` and log in with your GitHub account
### 3. When you enter the IDE, create a file with the program name (along with the `.c` ending). Example: mario.c
### 4. Copy and paste into the file the code you want to test
### 5. Open the integrated terminal and type `make <filename without .c>` and then type `./<filename without .c>`

**Observation:** Some projects were developed with extensions created by the course, so I recommend using the [CS50 IDE](https://code.cs50.io/) to run the codes.
