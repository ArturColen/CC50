Repository created to share the projects developed during the [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) Introduction to Computer Science course, where I was able to learn about several programming and development technologies.

## üöß Projects
### C
* **Mario:** recreating the pyramids of Mario World on the terminal;
* **Cash:** creating a counter for the amount of coins (cents) to be given as change to a user.
* **Credit:** generation of a credit card verifier, where you can find out if your format is valid, as well as your flag.
* **Population:** creation of a calculator for the number of years it will take for a given population to go from one value to another.
* **Readability:** program created to analyze, through a text entered by the user, its readability level using the Coleman-Liau index.
* **Caesar:** development of a project that performs the encryption of a sentence from Caesar's calculus.
* **Substitution:** creation a program that encrypts a sentence from a code entered by the user.
* **Scrabble:** development of the scrabble game, in which two people must type a word and the winner is the one with the highest score (from the sum of the values of each letter of the word).
* **Plurality:** program created to enter the names of the candidates in a given election and validate which was the winner based on the number of votes received.
* **Runoff:** project developed to obtain the result of an election using a ranking choice voting system, where it is possible to vote for more than one candidate and the result of all the users' choices will elect the candidate.
* **Tideman:** the Tideman program is similar to Runoff (it is an order-of-priority voting method), but it checks the winner by pairs of candidates.
* **Filter:** the project is intended to fix the knowledge of memory space that each part of a C project requires. Thus, the program developed consists of filtering images by manipulating their pixels.

## üíª Technologies used 
* [C](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/cpp/c-language/?view=msvc-170): programming language

## üìÅ Access and execute the projects
## C
### 1. Open the [CS50 IDE](https://code.cs50.io/)
### 2. Click `Log in via GitHub` and log in with your GitHub account
### 3. When you enter the IDE, create a file with the program name (along with the `.c` ending). Example: mario.c
### 4. Copy and paste into the file the code you want to test
### 5. Open the integrated terminal and type `make <filename without .c>` and then type `./<filename without .c>`

**Observation:** Some projects were developed with extensions created by the course, so I recommend using the [CS50 IDE](https://code.cs50.io/) to run the codes.
